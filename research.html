<h2>Modeling and simulation of tissue regeneration using high resolution cell model.</h2>


The goal is to get insight in the mechanical stress levels experienced by the hepatocytes during liver tissue regeneration, and clarify the relation with tissue architecture. I am elaborating on a previously introduced high resolution Deformable Cell Model in 3D  (see Fig. 1) that is capable of accurately representing cell deformation and integrating information at subcellular scales [2]. In a basic DCM the cell surface is discretized 
by a number of nodes which are connected by viscoelastic elements interacting via pairwise potential functions, creating a flexible scaffolding structure with arbitrary degrees of freedom per cell. I have extended the model with the capability for the cells to grow and divide. As a proof of concept I demonstrated the realism in a simulation of a regenerating liver lobule after drug-induced liver tissue damage compared to experimental data (see Fig.2). This model now includes realistic internal mechanics, contact/adhesion mechanics, and growth and division and should become a new standard in agent-based tissue simulations.



<h2>Modeling stress inhibited cell growth</h2>

Here, I studied  growth dynamics of tumor cells (proliferation, growth, necrosis) under different mechanical pressure conditions  (see two experiments in  Fig. 3 ). This phenomenon is reminiscent to tumor cells experiencing the influence of the surrounding stroma. I have developed an agent-based model that takes into account mechanical stress and cell density, to test hypotheses concerning cell growth under stress conditions. The basic model consists of cells represented by homogeneous adhesive and compressible spheres. In this work, it was demonstrated that the cellular growth response on external mechanical stress may be surprisingly quantitatively predictable, independently of the environmental conditions (submitted recently [9]). 


<h2>Modeling of cell-ECM interactions </h2>

The influence of mechanical feedback loop between cells and Extra-Cellular Matrix (ECM) is poorly understood.  In collaboration with Dr. Margriet Palm (U. of Leiden) I have created a model for cells to migrate through ECM, whereby the ECM is explicitly represented (see Fig. 4). The cells can change shape (form spheres to cylindrical like shape) and have anchoring points (filopodia) that are connected to the ECM. The ECM is modeled by a discrete network of viscoelastic elements. By a sequence of pulling and retracting the anchors, the cells can move through the ECM. As such we can quantify both the stresses that work on the cells and the ECM. This work is currently 
ongoing.
