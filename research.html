<h2>Modeling and simulation of tissue regeneration using high resolution cell model.</h2>


The goal is to get insight in the mechanical stress levels experienced by the hepatocytes during liver tissue regeneration, and clarify the relation with tissue architecture. I am elaborating on a previously introduced high resolution Deformable Cell Model in 3D  (see Fig. 1) that is capable of accurately representing cell deformation and integrating information at subcellular scales [2]. In a basic DCM the cell surface is discretized 
by a number of nodes which are connected by viscoelastic elements interacting via pairwise potential functions, creating a flexible scaffolding structure with arbitrary degrees of freedom per cell. I have extended the model with the capability for the cells to grow and divide. As a proof of concept I demonstrated the realism in a simulation of a regenerating liver lobule after drug-induced liver tissue damage compared to experimental data (see Fig.2). This model now includes realistic internal mechanics, contact/adhesion mechanics, and growth and division and should become a new standard in agent-based tissue simulations.

<h2>Modeling stress inhibited cell growth</h2>

Here, I studied  growth dynamics of tumor cells (proliferation, growth, necrosis) under different mechanical pressure conditions  (see two experiments in  Fig. 3 ). This phenomenon is reminiscent to tumor cells experiencing the influence of the surrounding stroma. I have developed an agent-based model that takes into account mechanical stress and cell density, to test hypotheses concerning cell growth under stress conditions. The basic model consists of cells represented by homogeneous adhesive and compressible spheres. In this work, it was demonstrated that the cellular growth response on external mechanical stress may be surprisingly quantitatively predictable, independently of the environmental conditions (submitted recently [9]).

<h2>Modeling of cell-ECM interactions </h2>

The influence of mechanical feedback loop between cells and Extra-Cellular Matrix (ECM) is poorly understood.  In collaboration with Dr. Margriet Palm (U. of Leiden) I have created a model for cells to migrate through ECM, whereby the ECM is explicitly represented (see Fig. 4). The cells can change shape (form spheres to cylindrical like shape) and have anchoring points (filopodia) that are connected to the ECM. The ECM is modeled by a discrete network of viscoelastic elements. By a sequence of pulling and retracting the anchors, the cells can move through the ECM. As such we can quantify both the stresses that work on the cells and the ECM. This work is currently 
ongoing.

<h1>Past  </h1> (before 2013)
	      
<h2>Development of ”Deformable Cell Model“: modeling of arbitrary shaped cells with high
detail</h2>

The majority of agent based models in the past were build on the
assumption of a rigid shaped cells (so-called center based models:
e.g. spheres, ellipsoids). In a some problems, such simplifications
suffice to accurately simulate the biological or clinical problem (e.g.
tumor growth [6]). Yet, as more and more detail about cell shape

and bio-mechanical forces is getting required nowadays, the devel-
opment of more complex models has become timely. In collabora-
tion with my former lab in KULeuven, and based on the 3D cell

model developed during my KULeuven post-doc work, I further
elaborated on a so-calledDeformable Cell Model (DCM), which is now a state-of-the-art model for a cell.
Many aspects of the subcellular structure, such a membranes, cytoskeleton, nucleus and organelles can be
quantified within this framework [3]. This model type therefore allows simulations where cells shape and
subcellular detail are important variables (but is more limited in cell numbers as compared to center based

models). In this particular research, we studied the adhesion dynamics of cells to a surface. The newly de-
veloped contact adhesion model is a discretization of a well known continuum theory (Maugis-Dugdale).

The model gives very good results with respect to experiments and lead to several new insights [7]. The
principals of this contact model can also be further exploited to study contact mechanics of irregularly
shaped rigid bodies in DEM [8].

<h2>Modeling of red blood cells in Stokes flow</h2>

Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a Lagrangian mesh-
free particle based method to simulate Navier-Stokes dynamics involving free surfaces, large deformations and complex physics.

However, processes at cellular scale are usually viscosity domi-
nated (overdamped) and hence a Stokes regime can be assumed.

I developed an SPH solver for fluid flows in Stokes regime. The method (called NSPH) is based on the standard SPH technique but

reduces it to a first order system and involves a different numerical solving scheme [9]. Thanks to this, longer timescales can be

simulated, typically needed in cellular processes. I applied this
method to the dynamics of a red blood cell passing a through a
narrow channel (capillary). The blood plasma was modeled by
NSPH, while the red blood cell was represented by a connection of
elastic elements (cfr. DEM).

<h2>Modeling of viscoelastic bio-fluids </h2>

During my last year as a researcher at KUL, I created a numerical model for simulations of viscoelastic bio-fluid flow. This project was a bilateral collaboration between KULeuven and the com-
pany MOBA N.V (The Netherlands) to understand and optimize the yield of albumen in industrial egg breaking machines. This is a very complicated process as the egg contents contain non-
Newtonian fluids, membranes and complex geometries. To get insight in the process of albumen outflow in eggs, I built a Smoothed

Particle Hydrodynamics model for simulating viscoelastic fluids (Maxwell model) including surface tension, see Fig. 8. The model

encompassed a 3D realistic egg shell geometry with inside a distinct egg yolk and albumen. However, the results of this project are confidential.

<h2>Multiscale modeling of cellular mechanics in tissue.</h2>
	      
	      
	      
During my late PhD and early post-doc years, I gained interest in simulation of living matter, i.e cells and
tissue [10]. I became involved in a multiscale project and collaboration between two KUL reseach groups.
The goal in this project was to understand how cellular tissue responds to dynamic mechanical load.

Hereby, the project aimed at providing insights on how two numerical methodologies in mechanical modeling of tissue, whereby one is interested in linking microscopic properties (cellular level) to macroscopic (tissue-level) behavior, can be
cast into an integrative approach. This work was a scientifically very successful collaboration between the Mebios lab (Faculty of Bio-engineering, KULeuven) and the department of applied math-
ematics (Faculty of Engineering, KULeuven). The tissue-level is assumed to behave viscoelastic and

simulated using nonlinear Finite Element Methods, while the cellular scale is approached by particle based methods and incorporated the subcellular features such as cytoplasm viscosity, cell shape,

etc. (see Fig. 9).



The coupling between the two scales was achieved using computational homogenization techniques and Representative Volume Elements (RVEs). This

project was financed by the Research Fund of Flanders (FWO) and the KULeuven and run from the

year 2006 to 2010. My personal contribution to the results of this project is the development of the

micro-scale model and partially also to the multiscale coupling. The microscale model involves a physical representation of cells and their parts (membranes, cytoplasm, nucleus, ..). The cells interact with each other by adhesive forces. Small groups of cells form a aggregate that represents a
small but repetitive part of the tissue. The model is able to simulate large deformations and even breakage of cells under impact load (see Fig. 10) [11, 12, 13].
This project resulted in a working code that uses microscopic physical properties of cells (e.g. cytoplasm
viscosity, cell wall Young modulus, cellular structure) and predicts the overall constitutive behavior of
the resulting tissue within a feasible computation time [14, 15]. This work greatly contributed to my
understanding of multiscale methods. Several innovative contributions to the field in order to accomplish
the mission of this project had to be introduced:
+ Construction and implementation of a detail mechanical model of a biological cell with flexibility
towards physical features and high accuracy.
+ Introduction of viscous inter-particle forces posed challenging problems with regard to the standard

computational homogenization strategies. However, we successfully developed a technique to incor-
porate these effects in the boundary value problem for the Representative Volume Element.
